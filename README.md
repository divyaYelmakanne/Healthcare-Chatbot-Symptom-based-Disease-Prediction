# 🩺 Healthcare Chatbot (Symptom-based Disease Prediction)


## 📌 Overview

This project is a healthcare chatbot that predicts possible diseases based on user-reported symptoms.
It uses a Decision Tree Classifier trained on a medical dataset with 132 symptoms and 41 diseases.
The chatbot interacts with the user, stores their symptoms, and predicts the disease when the user types done.
It also provides disease description and precautionary measures.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
'''
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-chatbot.git
cd healthcare-chatbot
'''

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
'''
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
'''

3. Install dependencies:
'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''


## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the chatbot:
'''
python chatbot.py
'''

'''


## 📊 Dataset Info

1. Training.csv

Rows: Thousands of records
Columns: 132 symptoms + 1 Disease label

2. Testing.csv

Similar format, used for evaluation

3. symptom_Description.csv

41 rows (Disease → Description)

4. symptom_precaution.csv

41 rows (Disease → 4 precautions)


## 🧠 How it Works

1. User enters symptoms one by one.

2. Symptoms are stored in a list.

3. When user types done, the chatbot:

-> Creates a feature vector (binary matrix for symptoms).
-> Runs it through the trained Decision Tree model.
-> Predicts the most likely disease.
-> Fetches description and precautions from CSV.

4. Displays results to the user.
